## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/soksamnanglim/CSCI152-neural-networks/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

# Header 1
Project: Diabetic Retinopathy
## Header 2
Goals

For my project, I would like to train neural networks (possibly with a CNN) to detect and classify diabetic retinopathy using photographs of retinas with and without hemorrhages. As an extension, I would also like to train other image processing neural networks on this dataset and compare their accuracies. Then, I would like to possibly predict the stage and progression of retinopathy, and assess the accuracy of the model in classifying retinopathy and predicting the stage/progression of the disease. The extension of this project may encounter some difficulties surrounding the existence and public availability of such a dataset.

Project Goals:

Find/clean a dataset of images.
Train a model to classify images of diabetic retinopathy.
Test the model with varying levels of noise.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/soksamnanglim/CSCI152-neural-networks/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
